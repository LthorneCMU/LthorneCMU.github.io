        <h1> I'm currently working on: </h1>
            <p> Perhaps you've heard of the neutrino, a particle said to be very small and travelling at the speed of light. It's a particle many scientists across many subfields world-wide are keen on understanding better. The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment, or KATRIN, aims to do just that. This is a next-generation detector, which looks at the tail-end of the tritium's beta spectrum to tell us about what the neutrino's absolute mass is. </p>
            <p> As the final step before the big measurement, we must characterize the detector, with all its subsystems, as a whole. I'm involved in this process in the following ways:

                <p> Shown left is the stability for all pixels in ring 5 of the silicon detector, in terms of the fitted peak's mean (top), width (middle), and height (bottom). Most fluctuations are within a 0.1% level, so tolerable. The roughness in the second half of the runs is due to the fact that the electrons are guided in a very tight beam towards the center, so statistics are low out at the fifth ring. </p></div>
